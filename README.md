## Abstract

The Julia programming language has evolved into a modern alternative to fill existing gaps in the requirements of
scientific computing and data science applications. Julia comes with a unified and coordinated single-language and
ecosystem paradigm, and has a proven track record at achieving high-performance without sacrificing user productivity.
This makes it a viable alternative to the existing increasingly costly many-body workflow composition strategy in
high-performance computing (HPC), i.e., using traditional HPC languages (Fortran, C, C++) for simulations and
higher-level languages (Python, R, Matlab) suitable for data analysis. Juliaâ€™s rapid growth in language capabilities,
package ecosystem, and community make it a promising new universal language for HPC. This paper presents the
views of a multidisciplinary group of researchers in academia, government, and industry advocating for an HPC software
development paradigm that emphasizes developer productivity, workflow portability, and low barriers for entry. We believe
that the Julia programming language, its ecosystem, and its community, provide modern and powerful capabilities which
enable this groups objectives. Crucially, we believe that Julia can provide a more feasible and less costly approach to
program scientific applications and workflows targeting HPC facilities. We examine the current practice and role of
Julia as a common end-to-end programming model to address major challenges in scientific reproducibility, data-driven
artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), co-design and workflows, scalability and performance portability in
heterogeneous computing, network, data management, and community education. As a result, we consider necessary
the diversification of current investments to fulfill the needs of the upcoming decade as more supercomputing centers
prepare for the Exascale era.

## Numerical experiments

To reproduce the numerical experiments, you need to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
